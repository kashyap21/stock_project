# stock_project
Reason - This project is for code review at stack builders



About the APP

The APP will manage your stock holdings and eventually can be implemented as Dividend Tracker for stocks

I used Django & Django rest framework to show my coding style. 
I also utilized test cases for Stock app, however I will add test cases for portfolio app later.

Also we can utilized celery to send email to the user or to run cron job.
